# Research and Teaching Codes

Here you can find the code for my published (and teaching) projects.

Folder [Teaching R](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Research/tree/main/Teaching_R) displays my Tutorials for the course Computer-aided Statistical Analysis in R. I follow the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (ISLR) that can be downloaded for free here: https://www.statlearning.com/. I draw on different online resources and present solutions for several of the exercises in the book with detailed coding instructions.
