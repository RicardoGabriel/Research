* Project: Monetary Policy and the Wage-Inflation Unemployment Trade-off
* Author: Ricardo Duque Gabriel
* First Date: 30/06/2019
* Last Update: 04/05/2022
* Predicted running time: 10 minutes
* to run a faster specification change global grid to 50 (e.g.)
*
* Some commands necessary to run/install before running this code:
* ssc install hprescott
* ssc install weakivtest
* ssc install estout
* ssc install rangerun
* ssc install rangestat
* ssc install ivreghdfe
* ssc install reghdfe
* ssc install ftools
* ssc install graph3d

* Master - choose number of horizons for the IRFs
global hf 		= 10

* Master - choose number of lags for the IRFs
global lags 	= 2

* Master - use matched sample (that is, all horizons with same # obs)
global match 	= 1

* Master - estimation of AR conf bands: set number of gridpoints and conf level
global gridd 	= 100
global levell 	= 90

* Master - choose whether outlier is identified when wage inflation is above 50% in absolute value (fifty=1)
* 		   or when it is either in top or bottom 1% of the sample (fifty=0) - robustness check
global fifty 	= 1

* Master - produce figure for slides (slides==1) or for paper (slides==0)
global slides	= 0

* Master - asymmetry specifications, choose one at a time from the following list
	* lowflat 	-	low vs high cpi inflation
	* boombust	-	bust vs boom in the economy (negative or positive unemployment gap using an hp filter)
	* negpos 	-	negative vs positive change in short run interest rate 
	* tradeoc 	-	degree of trade openess (more vs less) measured by having more than 40% of (imports+exports) / gdp (40% is close to mean and median)
	* capitaloc	-	degree of capital openess (open vs close) measured as in Quinn et al. (2011)
	* postwar   -   d
global state 	= "lowflat"
